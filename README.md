# w3m-dmenu
This script allows using native w3m bookmarks and history using dmenu
The script is inspired from "boosta-view" --> https://github.com/okraits/boosta
Simply put the file w3bookmarks in your path, make it executable and bind to your preferred shortcut key.

You can use rofi in place of dmenu, just change "dmenu" to "rofi -dmenu"
